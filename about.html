<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
Hi there! I’m John O’Reilly, the proud owner of a small but passionate car business. I’ve always loved cars — not just how they look, but the stories behind them. From vintage classics to modern speed machines, every car has a spirit that deserves to shine.
</p>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
My goal is to make car shopping fun and friendly. I like to mix a bit of humour with a lot of knowledge, so you can enjoy learning about cars while finding your dream ride. Whether you’re here to browse, buy, or just have a laugh, you’re in the right place!
</p>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
Thanks for visiting my site and being part of this journey. Stay tuned — there’s always a new “Car of the Week” waiting to make you smile!
